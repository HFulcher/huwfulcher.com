## What's a 'Digital Garden?'

Digital Garden is a bit of a loose term, over time it's been used for:

1. Tidying your digital life
2. Spring cleaning hardware/software
3. *The intersection between notebook and blog*[^1]

Compared to a blog where posts are organised chronologically, content is polished and rarely updated. Digital Gardens are like networks of thoughts/observations/ideas that build over time, creating new connections and updating information. The best part about Digital Gardens is that they aren't meant to be polished, they're meant to be pottered around in, tweaking things here and there as our knowledge grows.

How maintained I keep this 'garden' remains to be seen but I thought it would be a fun project.
