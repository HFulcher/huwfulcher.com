Hi, I'm Huw. Currently a Technical Consultant (Tech Lead) at 
[CACI IIG](https://www.caci.co.uk/business-areas/caci-iig/) but with a 
background in Data Science. You can find out more about my career through my 
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/huwfulcher), I can send a CV on request.

## What Iâ€™m interested in 
### Professionally
I'm at a crossroads in my professional life currently. Historically I've been
a Data Scientist who has gradually transitioned into MLOps and now into Software
Engineering.

I still have a strong interest in MLOps, so much so that I [started a website
dedicated to it](https://mlopsnow.com).

What I am looking towards now as I move into my 30's is where I can be best 
placed to improve the lives of those around me and in society. To that end 
I've had a look at [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/), although I'm not 
fully convincned on it. Maybe I'll write about that soon.



### Non-professionally
My interests change as much as the weather so this likely won't be up to date:

- Information Preservation: How do we ensure our information is available for 
the next generation?
- Information Retrieval: Tied to the above, if we are preserving so much 
information, how do we enable others to sift it to find the most useful things?
Of particular interest is the use of GenAI at a community level to aid learning
and discovery.
- Sustainable Technology: Drawing on some of the inspiration of [Solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk).
What would it look like for us to use technology to improve our environment,
communities and lives? Rather than using it purely for profit and entertainment.
- Sustainable Machine Learning: Similar to the above. How do we offset the 
impact that Machine Learning has on the environment?

I'm going to [start putting my thoughts and longer form pieces here for people to read](/blog/).
There will be a mix of my technical discussions and non-technical pursuits as well.


## Outside work

I'm a husband and father to two, a Christian and a big Star Trek fan (TNG is the best).
