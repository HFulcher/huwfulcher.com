Hi, I'm Huw. Currently a Senior Software Engineer at [CACI IIG](https://www.caci.co.uk/business-areas/caci-iig/) but with a background in Data Science. You can find out more about my career from my [cv]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/cv.pdf).

## Current Interests

- MLOps - How can we build robust, scalable, rapid deployment pipelines to get models into production?
- Information Retrieval - With more unstructured information than ever before, how do we sift, sort and retrieve it?
- Knowledge Bases - Tightly related to Information Retrieval, how do we use advancements in Knowledge Bases to make information easier to access, share and understand?

## Outside work

Outside of my work I am a big Star Trek fan and a practicing Christian. You can find my thoughts on everything from work to personal interests on my [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog).

If you want to discuss any of the above then please get in touch through the social buttons at the bottom of this page. I'm also interested in collaborating with others on research in any of the "Current Interests" areas above. I look forward to hearing from you!
