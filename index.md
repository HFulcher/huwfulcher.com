### Current Interests

<!-- | MLOps | How can we build robust, scalable, rapid deployment pipelines to get models into production? |
| Information Retrieval | With more unstructured information than ever before, how do we sift, sort and retrieve it? |
| Knowledge Bases | Tightly related to Information Retrieval, how do we use advancements in Knowledge Bases to make information easier to access, share and understand? |
| Cashless Societies | How do we reduce dependency on money while also ensuring that individuals retain autonomy over it? | -->
