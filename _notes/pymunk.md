# pymunk

*Pymunk is a easy-to-use pythonic 2d physics library that can be used whenever you need 2d rigid body physics from Python. Perfect when you need 2d physics in your game, demo or simulation! It is built on top of the very capable 2d physics libraryÂ [Chipmunk](http://chipmunk-physics.net/).*

## Setting up a simulation
Install `pymunk` and `pygame`:

```bash
pip install pymunk pygame
```

The simulation will have a number of key components:

1. The screen (powered by `pygame`)
2. The simulation space (powered by `pymunk`)
3.
