1. Markup/think in your books/articles/podcast/etc (Fleeting notes) ^7ca267
2. After each chapter pull relevant quotes/thoughts into a note specifically for that book/article/podcast/etc
3. Reword the quotes/thoughts as I see fit to expand each atom until a fully formed version of itself. e.g. go from just a quote to writing my thought on that quote
4. Take each atom (ideally formatted into paragraphs) and give them a descriptive title that can be used for a linked note. **This links the thought to its source but not to other thoughts yet!**
5. Stop and think about how this thought connects to others and start making links
