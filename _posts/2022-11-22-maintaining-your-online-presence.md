title: Maintaining your online presence

With the recent shakeup at Twitter and Twitter 2.0 incoming I've been 
thinking about what it means to reside on the Internet and have a place 
in it. What I capture in this post is not meant to be authoritative but a way 
to flesh out some thoughts and ideas.

## The Internet is about information first
The Internet has always had at its foundation the sharing of knowledge. When
the World Wide Web was first created it was for the purpose of sharing information
between institutions and individuals. This ability to share information (almost)
freely and widely has contributed massively to the development of society.

Whether we scroll a news feed, watch a video or


## Twitter obfuscates the sharing of information


## Federated services like Mastodon offer a way to rediscover the World Wide Web


## Blue Tick Twitter re-emphasises the need for maintaining your identity online


## Having a website is a good way to contribute to the network


## We need a closer link between networks of communication and websites


## Twitter 2.0 is an opportunity for positive change, regardless of Elon Musk
