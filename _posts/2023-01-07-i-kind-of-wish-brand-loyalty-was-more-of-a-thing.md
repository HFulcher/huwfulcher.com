title: I wish brand loyalty was more of a thing
excerpt: Connecting with brands more enriches our life

In a previous job I worked for an agency who were big on helping clients to develop
[brand loyalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_loyalty). Understandably,
the main driver for brand loyalty for businesses most of the time is a bigger
market share and more profit, but from a customer side I've been mulling over
how brand loyalty can actually enrich our lives as well.

## A symbol of aspiration

Recently, my wife and I stayed at the [Celtic Manor](https://www.celtic-manor.com/)
for a night to have a babymoon. We've stayed a couple of times before for short
stays and have absolutely loved it. For Wales, the Celtic Manor is pretty unique
in its size and quality (although it has diminished a bit in recent years), and 
the story of how it came to be and the man behind it is quite inspirational.

The manor used to be a maternity hospital where [Terry Matthews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Matthews)
was born. Terry started his career in electronics and after a failed start in
entrepenurship, successfully started a tech consultancy. While he made his fortune
in Canada he came back to Wales to buy the hospital where he was born when it closed
and redevelop it into a 5* resort that has seen it host the 2010 Ryder Cup and 
the 2014 NATO Summit.

*Fun fact: Terry Matthews was Wales' first billionare*

Celtic Manor (now, Celtic Collection) is a brand that I resonate with and like to
support. It represents the capability of Welsh born, welsh educated people to 
become a success and also for Wales to be a host on the international stage and 
not just England's poor relation.

It's brands like Celtic Collection that I wish we had more of, success stories of 
local people now giving back to their community through jobs and ammenities. I
don't for a minute doubt that Terry Matthew's primary drive was investment to 
further his career, that's how business works but I also admire his desire to
uplift Wales. The [Alacrity Foundation](https://alacrityfoundation.co.uk/) that
Terry is also involved in is a startup incubator for graduates in Wales, another
example of business supporting thsoe around them.

## A way to make a difference

Admittedly, I don't know much about the practices of [Patagonia](https://patagonia.com)
but on the surface they seem to be walking the talk. Donating 1% of their profits 
every year, working towards a [circular economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy)
and now the transferring of Patagonia to a trust to better distribute profits 
towards combating climate change.

While I don't own any Patagonia products and likely won't for a while (I'd love 
to be more outdoorsy but haven't yet, besides, I love [Finisterre](https://finisterre.com/)
which is more local) I can admire the activism of the brand.

## I want brand loyalty to be more about purpose than product

In a world with rampant consumerism, choosing what we buy and services we pay for 
is more important. For me, brands that go deeper than "making a profit" are 
more worthy of my wallet, even if they're more expensive.
