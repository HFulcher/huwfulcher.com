excerpt: If simplifying our life causes overwhelm, is it simplifying at all?
title: Simplifying your life shouldn’t cause overwhelm

A question I ask often and try and act on is “How can I simplify my life to the things I want **without feeling overwhelmed**?”

The fact I get overwhelmed in simplifying my life is a tell that I’m not actually simplifying my life at all.

If the act of simplifying is causing overwhelm then I suspect it’s actually about putting more concerted effort on **doing** certain things more rather than **living** them.

I’ve developed an unhealthy relationship between focus and doing. To focus on something is to do more of it. Instead, I need to think about focus as “dwelling” in a part of my life more.

Rather than **doing** more in my life I need to focus on being **present** in my life more.

Once I actually start occupying my life and experiencing it then doing things can naturally flow from that.

An example: Focusing more on my family life will give me better perspective on what I already have (what went well) and how I can nurture it even more (even better if).

A lot of the time I strike out to do things that I think I should do before I’ve even sat and experienced what it is I’m trying to change. Maybe it doesn’t need changing at all.
