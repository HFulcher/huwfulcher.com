Hi, I'm Huw. Currently a Technical Consultant (Tech Lead) at 
[CACI IIG](https://www.caci.co.uk/business-areas/caci-iig/) but with a 
background in Data Science. You can find out more about my career through my 
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/huwfulcher), I can send a CV on request.

## What Iâ€™m interested in 
My interests change as much as the weather so this likely won't be up to date:

- Cryptocurrencies - Particularly Bitcoin. I'm not interested in making money off it, I'm interested in how decentralised currency can give freedom to society.
- Indie Hacking - My long term goal is to be completely self-employed with multiple revenue streams. Maybe I'll talk about that here in future.
- Paganism and Christianity - What draws people to Paganism over Christianity?
- Contemplative practices in Christianity - I belong to a tradition that focuses more on scripture than contemplation and prayer. I'm interested in how we can recover contemplative practices to deepen our faith.


I talk a lot on Twitter about my interests, get involved!

I'm a husband and Father to two, a big Star Trek fan
and a practicing Christian. You can find my thoughts on everything from work to
personal interests on my [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).
