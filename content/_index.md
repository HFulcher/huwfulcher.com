Hi, I'm Huw. Currently a Technical Consultant (Tech Lead) at 
[CACI IIG](https://www.caci.co.uk/business-areas/caci-iig/) but with a 
background in Data Science. You can find out more about my career through my 
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/huwfulcher), I can send a CV on request.

## What Iâ€™m interested in 
My interests change as much as the weather so this likely won't be up to date:

- Cryptocurrencies - Particularly Bitcoin. I'm not interested in making money off it, I'm interested in how decentralised currency can give freedom to society.
- Web3/Decentralised technology - To make it clear, I **hate** NFTs.
- Indie Hacking - My long term goal is to be completely self-employed with multiple revenue streams. Maybe I'll talk about that here in future.

I talk a lot on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/huwdev) about my interests, get involved!

## Outside work

I'm a husband and Father to two, a big Star Trek fan
and a practicing Christian. You can find my thoughts on everything from work to
personal interests on my [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).

This is a test [link]({{< ref "/contact" >}}).
