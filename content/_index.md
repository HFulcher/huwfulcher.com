Hi, I'm Huw. Currently a Technical Consultant (Tech Lead) at 
[CACI IIG](https://www.caci.co.uk/business-areas/caci-iig/) but with a 
background in Data Science. You can find out more about my career through my 
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/huwfulcher), I can send a CV on request.

## What Iâ€™m interested in 
### Professionally
I'm at a crossroads in my professional life currently. Historically I've been
a Data Scientist who has gradually transitioned into MLOps and now into Software
Engineering.

I still have a strong interest in MLOps, so much so that I [started a website
dedicated to it](https://mlopsnow.com). But I'm starting to feel burnt out 
by working for companies.

My dream is to find my niche that I can work independently in to generate enough
income to pursure things I find more fulfilling.



### Non-professionally
My interests change as much as the weather so this likely won't be up to date:

- Contemplative practices in Christianity - I belong to a tradition that 
focuses more on scripture than contemplation and prayer. I'm interested in how 
we can recover contemplative practices to deepen our faith.
- Amateur space research - I despair that I can't enlist with Starfleet so the 
next best thing I can think of doing is helping us get there quicker.

I'm going to [start putting my thoughts and longer form pieces here for people to read]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).
There will be a mix of my technical discussions and non-technical pursuits as well.


## Outside work

I'm a husband and Father to two, a big Star Trek fan
and a practicing Christian.
