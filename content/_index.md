Hi, I'm Huw. Currently a Technical Consultant (Tech Lead) at 
[CACI IIG](https://www.caci.co.uk/business-areas/caci-iig/) but with a 
background in Data Science. You can find out more about my career through my 
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/huwfulcher), I can send a CV on request.

## What Iâ€™m interested in 
### Professionally
I'm at a crossroads in my professional life currently. Historically I've been
a Data Scientist who has gradually transitioned into MLOps and now into Software
Engineering.

I still have a strong interest in MLOps, so much so that I [started a website
dedicated to it](https://mlopsnow.com).

What I am looking towards now as I move into my 30's is where I can be best placed to improve the lives of those around me and in society. To that end I've had a look at [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/), although I'm not fully convincned on it. Maybe I'll write about that soon.



### Non-professionally
My interests change as much as the weather so this likely won't be up to date:

- Information Preservation: How do we ensure our information is available for the next generation?
- Information Retrieval: Tied to the above, if we are preserving so much information, how do we enable others to sift it to find the most useful things?

I'm going to [start putting my thoughts and longer form pieces here for people to read]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).
There will be a mix of my technical discussions and non-technical pursuits as well.


## Outside work

I'm a husband and father to two, a Christian and a big Star Trek fan (TNG is the best).
