My blog is pretty simple, no tags (might change depending on the breadth of content
in future) and just chronological. 

9/10 these articles start as a smaller snippet from my [thoughts section](/thoughts).
My criteria for what I expand into an article can be boiled down to:

1. Is it rattling around my head for a while
2. Do I have the time & energy to write it
