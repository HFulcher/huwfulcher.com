Being a good father and husband isn't about the **monumental but the ordinary**.

If we think of it with the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle):

1. The Monumental - 20% of life that takes 80% of the effort
2. The Ordinary - 80% of life that takes 20% of the effort

Sometimes this can feel flipped around where "The Ordinary" takes up 80% of our effort.

What I see in my life is that I obsess too much over "getting it right", burning my energy on things that don't need it.
