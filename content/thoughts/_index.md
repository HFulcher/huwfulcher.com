title: Thoughts
---

Thoughts are those quotes, observations, musings that I've 
captured in my notebook and have decided would be worth
publishing here. Currently these aren't organised by category
but I plan on separating them out as so in future.

My hope with this section is to provide useful glimpses of 
things I have also seen. I am trying to turn myself into a 
more concious consumer of information, reviewing what I've
consumed and adding it here seems like a good practice.

From time to time some of these thoughts will grow into
articles on my [blog](/blog). If they do I'll make sure to
highlight so.
