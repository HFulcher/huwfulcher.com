"_Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward._" - Karis Nemik, Andor TV Series

The advantage we have as Christian's is that we will win. Not in the political sphere, but in the spiritual sphere. Every small victory expands the Kingdom. Random acts of rebellion across the world all working for a common cause.
