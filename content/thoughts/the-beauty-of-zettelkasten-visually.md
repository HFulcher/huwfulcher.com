I'm starting to experiment with Zettelkasten (or a lite version of it) in Obsidian. I've come across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RKNKbEYAlA) video that shows how someone's graph has changed over time. 

What I particularly like about it is that at the start there are a lot of orphaned notes that eventually get more interconnected. It helps reinforce the point that adequate links don't need to be made straight off the bat to be "doing it right". What matters is the long term revisiting and maintaining of the webs of thought.
