      <description>&amp;ldquo;Instead, Luther and the other Reformers wanted people to know that the sacrament is a place where we come to meet with Christ Himself, in whom alone grace is to be found. The supper is not our sacrifice offered to God, but God&amp;rsquo;s gift offered to us.&amp;rdquo; - The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper, Jonathan Black</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the idea that all you have to do is follow your passion&amp;rdquo; - Cal Newport, So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You, pg. 13
I&amp;rsquo;m often the joke of conversation about careers considering I&amp;rsquo;ve had 4 jobs in 6 years (by my own choice). It isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong for me to move with what is compelling, but what is the end goal?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they&amp;rsquo;ve already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.&amp;rdquo; - Karis Nemik, Andor TV Series
The advantage we have as Christian&amp;rsquo;s is that we will win. Not in the political sphere, but in the spiritual sphere.</description>

      <title>Being a good father and husband</title>

      <description>Being a good father and husband isn&amp;rsquo;t about the monumental but the ordinary.
If we think of it with the Pareto Principle:
The Monumental - 20% of life that takes 80% of the effort The Ordinary - 80% of life that takes 20% of the effort Sometimes this can feel flipped around where &amp;ldquo;The Ordinary&amp;rdquo; takes up 80% of our effort.
What I see in my life is that I obsess too much over &amp;ldquo;getting it right&amp;rdquo;, burning my energy on things that don&amp;rsquo;t need it.</description>
