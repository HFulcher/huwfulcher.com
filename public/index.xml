      <description>&amp;ldquo;Instead, Luther and the other Reformers wanted people to know that the sacrament is a place where we come to meet with Christ Himself, in whom alone grace is to be found. The supper is not our sacrifice offered to God, but God&amp;rsquo;s gift offered to us.&amp;rdquo; - The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper, Jonathan Black</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the idea that all you have to do is follow your passion&amp;rdquo; - Cal Newport, So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You, pg. 13
I&amp;rsquo;m often the joke of conversation about careers considering I&amp;rsquo;ve had 4 jobs in 6 years (by my own choice). It isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong for me to move with what is compelling, but what is the end goal?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they&amp;rsquo;ve already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.&amp;rdquo; - Karis Nemik, Andor TV Series
The advantage we have as Christian&amp;rsquo;s is that we will win. Not in the political sphere, but in the spiritual sphere.</description>

      <title>Being a good father and husband</title>

      <description>Being a good father and husband isn&amp;rsquo;t about the monumental but the ordinary.
If we think of it with the Pareto Principle:
The Monumental - 20% of life that takes 80% of the effort The Ordinary - 80% of life that takes 20% of the effort Sometimes this can feel flipped around where &amp;ldquo;The Ordinary&amp;rdquo; takes up 80% of our effort.
What I see in my life is that I obsess too much over &amp;ldquo;getting it right&amp;rdquo;, burning my energy on things that don&amp;rsquo;t need it.</description>

      <title>Simplifying your life shouldn’t cause overwhelm</title>

      <description>A question I ask often and try and act on is “How can I simplify my life to the things I want without feeling overwhelmed?”
The fact I get overwhelmed in simplifying my life is a tell that I’m not actually simplifying my life at all.
If the act of simplifying is causing overwhelm then I suspect it’s actually about putting more concerted effort on doing certain things more rather than living them.</description>

      <description>Matthew 13:31-32 (ESV)
[31] He put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. [32] It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.</description>

      <description>The best intentions It&amp;rsquo;s 2023, goals, aspirations and habits are being scribbled down by people round the world. All of this is being framed by a thought, &amp;ldquo;what should I be doing better this year?&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty standard thought that everyone has and I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that it&amp;rsquo;s bad but that it might hamstring us more than we think.
For me, the pressure to do things better has had a two fold effect on my mental health and also my ability to get things done.</description>

      <title>I wish brand loyalty was more of a thing</title>

      <description>In a previous job I worked for an agency who were big on helping clients to develop brand loyalty. Understandably, the main driver for brand loyalty for businesses most of the time is a bigger market share and more profit, but from a customer side I&amp;rsquo;ve been mulling over how brand loyalty can actually enrich our lives as well.

      <title>Capturing information by actionability not category</title>

      <description>Initially this post was going to a way to vent about Knowledge Bases/Second Brains and how they encourage &amp;ldquo;information gluttony&amp;rdquo; rather than mindful consumption and collection.
Doing some due diligence on the topic first I started watching Ali Abdaal&amp;rsquo;s video on building a second brain and found that actually it may be better than I thought.
Rather than waste the opportunity to put a post out I&amp;rsquo;m repurposing this article to explore a particular idea expressed in the video and by Tiago Forte, the author behind &amp;ldquo;Building a Second Brain&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Making a chain isn&#39;t as important as making an effort</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge for those with new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions that keeping track of your new habits with streaks (or chains) is touted as a way to achieve them. For the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve sought to take the same approach and crack out the habit tracker and make it a goal to keep the streaks running as long as possible. Unfortunately they always fizzle out far too quickly.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think that habit tracking in and of itself is bad but the mindset we can build around it can be a hinderance rather than a help.</description>

      <description>Introduction TinaCMS, the successor to Forestry has just gone to v1.0, bringing a stable, open-source, git based CMS to static sites. I&amp;rsquo;ve just started using TinaCMS with my site and I&amp;rsquo;m actually writing this post using it!
While there is some documentation on adding TinaCMS to a non-NextJS site there are few extra steps that are needed to get it working nicely with Jekyll.
1. Install TinaCMS npx @tinacms/cli@latest init Note: Docs as of (10/11/2022) specify a &amp;ndash;static flag, this is removed and won&amp;rsquo;t work Choose whatever package manager is preferable Choose Other when asked for a framework (Optional) Use Typescript, it is recommended When asked where public assets are stored specify the top level with /.</description>
