<h2>Simplifying your life shouldn’t cause overwhelm</h2>
<p><small><time datetime="2023-03-14">Mar 14, 2023</time></small></p>

<p>A question I ask often and try and act on is “How can I simplify my life to the things I want <strong>without feeling overwhelmed</strong>?”</p>
<p>The fact I get overwhelmed in simplifying my life is a tell that I’m not actually simplifying my life at all.</p>
<p>If the act of simplifying is causing overwhelm then I suspect it’s actually about putting more concerted effort on <strong>doing</strong> certain things more rather than <strong>living</strong> them.</p>
<p>I’ve developed an unhealthy relationship between focus and doing. To focus on something is to do more of it. Instead, I need to think about focus as “dwelling” in a part of my life more.</p>
<p>Rather than <strong>doing</strong> more in my life I need to focus on being <strong>present</strong> in my life more.</p>
<p>Once I actually start occupying my life and experiencing it then doing things can naturally flow from that.</p>
<p>An example: Focusing more on my family life will give me better perspective on what I already have (what went well) and how I can nurture it even more (even better if).</p>
<p>A lot of the time I strike out to do things that I think I should do before I’ve even sat and experienced what it is I’m trying to change. Maybe it doesn’t need changing at all.</p>
