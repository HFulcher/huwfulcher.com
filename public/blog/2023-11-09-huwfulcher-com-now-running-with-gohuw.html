<h2>huwfulcher.com, now running with gohuw</h2>
<p><small>Nov 9, 2023</small></p>

<p>While perusing <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> recently I came across <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38126210">Why You Should Write Your Own Static Site Generator</a>. Not one to turn down a challenge I decided that I should as well. Reasons being:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't like Hugo that much. It's definitely one of the best generators out there but I didn't like its structure or limitations it imposes.</li>
<li>I wanted to try Go. I've only gotten as far as &quot;Hello World&quot; previously with Go so doing a Static Site Generator seemed to be a good way to understand things.</li>
<li>I wanted a binary to run. I love the idea that with Go you can build a binary and then bundle that with your website. It means I have no external dependencies to weigh me down if I choose not to.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/HFulcher/gohuw">gohuw</a>, a Frankenstein-esque SSG that I wouldn't recommend others use. I have it on good authority from my Go expert friend that the code is bad. But that's okay, it does the job for me.</p>
<p>Why not call it &quot;huwgo&quot;? I felt that was a bit on the nose being so close to &quot;hugo&quot; and I didn't want people having the misunderstanding that I have written this to be widely adopted.</p>
<p>This was a fun project and something I'll likely try and replicate in other languages I want to learn (e.g. Rust). It provides a good range of techniques to be used and also ends with something actually useful.</p>
