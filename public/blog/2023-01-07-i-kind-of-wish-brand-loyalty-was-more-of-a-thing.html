<h2>I wish brand loyalty was more of a thing</h2>
<p><small>Jan 7, 2023</small></p>

<p>In a previous job I worked for an agency who were big on helping clients to develop
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_loyalty">brand loyalty</a>. Understandably,
the main driver for brand loyalty for businesses most of the time is a bigger
market share and more profit, but from a customer side I've been mulling over
how brand loyalty can actually enrich our lives as well.</p>
<h2 id="a-symbol-of-aspiration">A symbol of aspiration</h2>
<p>Recently, my wife and I stayed at the <a href="https://www.celtic-manor.com/">Celtic Manor</a>
for a night to have a babymoon. We've stayed a couple of times before for short
stays and have absolutely loved it. For Wales, the Celtic Manor is pretty unique
in its size and quality (although it has diminished a bit in recent years), and
the story of how it came to be and the man behind it is quite inspirational.</p>
<p>The manor used to be a maternity hospital where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Matthews">Terry Matthews</a>
was born. Terry started his career in electronics and after a failed start in
entrepenurship, successfully started a tech consultancy. While he made his fortune
in Canada he came back to Wales to buy the hospital where he was born when it closed
and redevelop it into a 5* resort that has seen it host the 2010 Ryder Cup and
the 2014 NATO Summit.</p>
<p><em>Fun fact: Terry Matthews was Wales' first billionare</em></p>
<p>Celtic Manor (now, Celtic Collection) is a brand that I resonate with and like to
support. It represents the capability of Welsh born, welsh educated people to
become a success and also for Wales to be a host on the international stage and
not just England's poor relation.</p>
<p>It's brands like Celtic Collection that I wish we had more of, success stories of
local people now giving back to their community through jobs and ammenities. I
don't for a minute doubt that Terry Matthew's primary drive was investment to
further his career, that's how business works but I also admire his desire to
uplift Wales. The <a href="https://alacrityfoundation.co.uk/">Alacrity Foundation</a> that
Terry is also involved in is a startup incubator for graduates in Wales, another
example of business supporting thsoe around them.</p>
<h2 id="a-way-to-make-a-difference">A way to make a difference</h2>
<p>Admittedly, I don't know much about the practices of <a href="https://patagonia.com">Patagonia</a>
but on the surface they seem to be walking the talk. Donating 1% of their profits
every year, working towards a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy">circular economy</a>
and now the transferring of Patagonia to a trust to better distribute profits
towards combating climate change.</p>
<p>While I don't own any Patagonia products and likely won't for a while (I'd love
to be more outdoorsy but haven't yet, besides, I love <a href="https://finisterre.com/">Finisterre</a>
which is more local) I can admire the activism of the brand.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-brand-loyalty-to-be-more-about-purpose-than-product">I want brand loyalty to be more about purpose than product</h2>
<p>In a world with rampant consumerism, choosing what we buy and services we pay for
is more important. For me, brands that go deeper than &quot;making a profit&quot; are
more worthy of my wallet, even if they're more expensive.</p>
